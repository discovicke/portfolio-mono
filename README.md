# Viktor Johansson — Portfolio

A modern, minimalist portfolio built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The design leans into a monochrome aesthetic, negative space, and clear typographic hierarchy to keep focus on content.

## Overview

This portfolio showcases selected projects, a short bio, and a clean modal-driven project viewer. It’s responsive and accessible, with language support via a simple i18n setup.

## Aesthetics & Design Challenge

I challenged myself to:
- Keep the site fully monochrome to reduce visual noise and emphasize structure.
- Use negative space and scale to create a natural information hierarchy.
- Avoid heavy frameworks on the styling side; prefer straightforward CSS modules and semantic HTML.

The result is a calm, readable interface where content leads and decoration follows.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```
Outputs production files to the `dist/` folder.

## Deploy

- Optimized for Vercel; see `vercel.json` for defaults.
- Typical settings: build `npm run build`, output `dist`, install `npm install`.
